   <h1>island in the sun</h1> 
    <h2>weezer</h2>  
    <p>Hip, hip
        Hip, hip
        Hip, hip
        Hip, hip <br>
        When you're on a holiday <br>
        You can't find the words to say <br>
        All the things that come to you <br>
        And I wanna feel it too <br>
        On an island in the sun <br>
        We'll be playin' and havin' fun<br>
        And it makes me feel so fine<br>
        I can't control my brain<br>
        Hip, hip<br>
        Hip, hip<br>
        When you're on a golden sea<br>
        You don't need no memory<br>
        Just a place to call your own<br>
        As we drift into the zone<br>
        On an island in the sun<br>
        We'll be playin' and havin' fun<br>
        And it makes me feel so fine<br>
        I can't control my brain<br>
        We'll run away together<br>
        We'll spend some time forever<br>
        We'll never feel bad anymore<br>
        Hip, hip<br>
